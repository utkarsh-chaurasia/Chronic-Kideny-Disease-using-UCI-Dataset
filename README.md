# Chronic-Kideny-Disease-using-UCI-Dataset
## Introduction
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a prevalent health condition affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of CKD can significantly improve patient outcomes and help healthcare providers develop effective treatment plans. Deep Learning, a subset of machine learning, has shown promising results in various medical applications, including disease prediction. In this report, we present a comprehensive analysis of CKD prediction using Deep Learning models with the UCI Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset.

## Libraries and Dataset
We start by importing the necessary libraries to perform data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

## Data Preprocessing
Data cleaning is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for model training. We address missing and erroneous values, ensuring that the data is in a suitable format for our analysis. Additionally, we handle label imbalances to prevent biased model performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of features and identify potential outliers. Data visualization techniques, such as histograms and box plots, are used to visualize the data's characteristics.

## Feature Engineering with PCA
Since Deep Learning models often benefit from reduced feature dimensions, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the data to reduce its dimensionality while preserving most of its variance. This step optimizes the model's performance by providing relevant features.

## Model Creation
We design a Deep Learning model for CKD prediction. The model architecture consists of several Dense layers with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions, followed by Dropout layers to reduce overfitting. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the training set and evaluated on the testing set. We record the accuracy and loss during training and assess the model's performance on the testing set using accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Performance Analysis
In this section, we analyze the model's performance in predicting CKD. We present the training and testing accuracy curves to observe how the model learns over epochs. Additionally, we compute precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's predictive ability.

## Results and Discussion
Based on the performance analysis, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the Deep Learning model for CKD prediction. We interpret the results and provide insights into potential areas for improvement.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, we have conducted a thorough analysis of CKD prediction using Deep Learning models with the UCI Dataset. The application of Deep Learning in medical diagnosis, particularly in CKD prediction, has shown promising results. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of the model in predicting CKD and its potential to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions for patient care.

## Future Directions
To further enhance the CKD prediction model, future research could explore the following areas:

Experiment with different Deep Learning architectures (e.g., CNN, LSTM) to compare their performance against the current model.
Investigate additional feature engineering techniques to improve the model's ability to extract relevant information from the dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance on external datasets to assess its generalization capability.
